# Feature Parity Todo

Status date: 2026-06-08.

This is the remaining work to keep `glade` at credible MVP parity and then push
beyond it. The current baselines are broad, and `glade compat mvp` is the
release gate for the required local MVP contract.

Current checked status:

- `glade compat mvp --json`: ready; 21 of 21 required capabilities are
  supported for the local MVP contract.
- `glade compat server-examples --json`: `pass=101 fail=0 unsupported=0
  missing=0`.
- `glade compat local-tests` dogfood proof should prioritize
  `sf-cred-pkg-develop`, `src-nmb-nu-develop`, and `nams-workspace`, with
  `src-nmb-nutpl-develop` (`total=761 pass=761`) as the fast runtime sentinel.
  Large-project green claims require fresh per-project JSON from the current
  checkout.
- Full example-project runtime support is still incomplete; NPSP and
  `src-nmb-nc-develop` remain separate frontier gates unless freshly rerun.
  Historical six-project baseline detail is tracked in
  `docs/fixtures/local-tests-example-projects.json`.
- Generated compatibility docs are in sync with `internal/capability`.

Parity means a local Apex development loop that can run real project tests,
execute anonymous Apex, support schema-aware SObjects/SOQL/DML/triggers,
enforce or report limits, provide usable debug/LSP/watch workflows, and expose
a Salesforce-shaped local API server without silently wrong behavior.

## Suggested Completion Order

1. Runtime fidelity: method-body sema, class/object execution, exceptions,
   properties, statics, namespaces, and no-panic VM behavior.
2. Test fidelity: transaction isolation, `@TestSetup`, static reset,
   start/stop windows, `runAs`, async drain, and assertion stack traces.
3. Data fidelity: SObject, SOQL, DML, triggers, rollback, and result/error
   shape coverage.
4. Limits and platform APIs: counters, strict/permissive enforcement, and
   common standard-library surfaces.
5. Fixtures and persistence: large SQLite-backed fixtures, deterministic
   platform data, seed/reset/export/import, and server state reset.
6. Developer experience: debug pause hooks, LSP completeness, watch
   cancellation, and native trace/profile reports.
7. Local API server: auth/user context, broader REST/Tooling/Composite
   resources, persistence, and error fidelity.
8. Compatibility and release: dashboard, black-box/enterprise fixtures,
   no-panic hardening, benchmarks, release artifacts, install docs, and
   known-gaps docs.
9. Beyond parity: query plans, cost attribution, anonymization, replay bundles,
   SARIF, API-versioned dashboard, plugins, fuzzing, and mutation testing.

## Parity Gate

- [ ] Make every `requiredForMVP` capability in `internal/capability`
  `supported`.
- [ ] Keep `glade compat mvp` as the release gate for calling the project
  MVP-ready.
- [ ] Require compatibility coverage before changing a feature from `partial`
  to `supported`.
- [ ] Treat panics on user Apex, metadata, fixtures, or API requests as release
  blockers.
- [ ] Treat silent wrong behavior as a release blocker for any supported
  feature.

  `LIKE`, comparison operators, `NOT`, and parenthesized conditions.
  - **Limitation**: Apex compiler does not support chained method calls
    (e.g., `obj.getErrors().get(0)`); intermediate variables are required.
  - **Limitation**: SOQL string literals inside Apex `[SELECT ...]` were missing
    quotes due to a compiler lexer bug; this has been fixed, but complex string
    escapes inside SOQL literals may still have edge cases.

  lock contention behavior, and advanced query row shape fidelity.
  - [x] Validate projected fields for `WITH SECURITY_ENFORCED`, `WITH USER_MODE`,
    and `WITH SYSTEM_MODE` queries and return catchable `QueryException`s for
    unavailable fields.
  - [x] Mark `FOR UPDATE` result records with a local lock marker and serialize
    queried SObjects with `attributes.type` and `attributes.url`.
  - [x] Return catchable `QueryException`s when `FOR UPDATE` hits an already
    locked local row.

    than full CRUD/FLS/sharing enforcement.

    engine validation.

    multiple `Database.Error` entries on `SaveResult`/`MergeResult`.
  - [x] Cascade soft-delete child records from relationship metadata.
  - **Limitation**: Full merge loser relationship result details and full
    undelete edge-case parity remain incomplete.

    in before-trigger DML with row-level `SaveResult` error shaping and

  permission sets, permission assignments, record types, and org settings.
  - [x] Seed deterministic `Organization`, `Profile`, `UserRole`, `User`,
    `PermissionSet`, `PermissionSetAssignment`, and `RecordType` objects.
  - [x] Add locale/timezone/language, role, and permission metadata fields for
    local user/org state.
  - [x] Materialize object record-type metadata as deterministic `RecordType`
    records.
- [x] Add fixture reset endpoints that can reset data, users, platform state,
  limits, and async queues deterministically.
  - [x] Support full reset plus scoped `data`, `users`, `platform`, `limits`,
    and `async` reset requests through path, query, and JSON body scopes.
  - [x] Keep data resets from clearing deterministic platform users/org state.
  - [x] Rebuild user/platform baseline records deterministically for users and
    platform resets.
- [x] Add persistent server database lifecycle docs and operational checks.
  - [x] Document `glade server --db` startup, DB seed/inspect/export/reset
    preparation, server fixture/reset endpoints, and restart persistence checks.
  - [x] Document operational checks for saved mutations and rollback-on-failure
    commit boundaries.
- [x] Add import/export compatibility tests for `glade db seed/reset/export/
  inspect`.
  - [x] Add a DB lifecycle compatibility fixture that seeds SQLite storage,
    inspects schema/data counts, exports the fixture shape, and verifies reset
    behavior.
  - [x] Re-import the exported fixture during compatibility execution and assert
    imported record, user, profile, and Account counts.
- [x] Add fixture schemas for enterprise selector/service/domain test suites.
  - [x] Extend compatibility `check` fixtures to write schema metadata files,
    load project schema, and report schema object counts.
  - [x] Add an enterprise selector/service/domain fixture with Account, Contact,
    and custom Invoice metadata.

## 7. Developer Experience

- [x] Add true live VM pause hooks for DAP at stable source locations.
  - [x] Add VM debug hooks that pause on statement line/column locations,
    expose stack/locals snapshots, support step pauses, and allow stop/continue
    actions.
- [x] Make breakpoints drive execution rather than only serving debug
  snapshots.
  - [x] Convert DAP breakpoints into VM debug breakpoints and add a DAP
    execution helper that runs to the first live breakpoint before the statement
    executes.
- [x] Complete DAP stepping: step in, step over, step out, pause, continue, and
  disconnect semantics.
  - [x] Add a live DAP session that blocks a VM goroutine at pauses and releases
    it through continue, pause, disconnect, step-in, step-over, and step-out
    commands.
  - [x] Use stack depth so step-over skips method bodies, step-in enters method
    bodies, and step-out returns to the caller frame.
- [x] Complete DAP scopes and variable rendering for SObjects, user objects,
  statics, collections, exceptions, and trigger context.
  - [x] Split DAP variables into Locals, Statics, and Trigger scopes, render
    object/SObject/exception fields as named child variables, preserve nested
    collection children, and expose static class fields from live VM pauses.
- [x] Complete watch expression evaluation against VM context.
  - [x] Evaluate paused-context watch expressions for locals, dotted object
    fields, static fields, `Trigger.*` context values, trigger shorthand roots,
    list/set numeric indexes, map string keys, and nested combinations without
    re-running VM code.
- [x] Add VS Code launch/task examples and editor documentation.
- [x] Expand `glade lsp` with incremental document sync.
  - [x] Handle `textDocument/didOpen`, `didChange`, and `didClose`, apply
    full-document or ranged incremental text edits to in-memory overlays, publish
    parse diagnostics from open buffers, and clear diagnostics on close.
- [x] Add LSP semantic tokens, definition, references, rename, and richer
  completion.
  - [x] Advertise semantic-token, definition, references, prepare-rename, and
    rename providers, return semantic tokens from indexed declarations, resolve
    definitions from cursor words to Apex/schema symbols, scan project/open
    buffers for references, build workspace edits for rename, and include
    members, schema fields, and Apex keywords in completion.
- [x] Make LSP diagnostics match `glade check` and test results consistently.
  - [x] Publish project sema/type diagnostics through the same diagnostic model
    used by `glade check`, overlay open-buffer parse diagnostics while editing,
    restore project diagnostics on close, and expose test-result diagnostics
    from failure stack frames.
- [x] Add native OS watcher backends for `glade test --watch`.
  - [x] Add `fsnotify` native watching with recursive directory registration,
    automatic fallback to polling in `auto` mode, explicit
    `--watch-backend auto|native|poll` selection, backend reporting in
    `watch.started`, and polling/native backend tests.
- [x] Add incremental re-indexing and affected-test dependency graph updates.
  - [x] Reuse the existing type index for Apex-only watch changes by replacing
    changed/deleted class and trigger symbols, fall back to full reload for
    schema metadata, and build a source-scanned dependency graph so production
    class changes select dependent tests before falling back to all tests.
- [x] Add in-flight VM/test cancellation for watch reruns.
  - [x] Thread context cancellation through the Apex test runner and VM
    instruction loop, run watch test executions asynchronously, cancel stale
    in-flight runs when a newer rerun starts, and suppress late results from
    canceled runs by run ID.
- [x] Stabilize watch JSON stream for editor/test UI consumers.
  - [x] Add `schemaVersion: 1` to each newline-delimited watch event, keep
    `runId` present on run events, emit `testClasses` as a stable array on
    `watch.run_started`, and cover the wire shape with exact JSON tests.
- [x] Expand profile/trace events for SOQL, DML, describe, callouts, limits,
  methods, triggers, and async.
  - [x] Keep existing statement/method/SOQL/DML trace events, add describe,
    callout, email, async enqueue/run, trigger invocation, and final governor
    limit summary events, and expand profile attribution for platform/resource
    counters.
- [x] Add native reports that fully replace apexrr-style analysis for local
  runtime data.
  - [x] Extend `glade profile analyze` JSON and Markdown output with native
    runtime sections for hot events, categories, statements, methods, SOQL, DML,
    triggers, describe, callouts, async, platform events, and governor/resource
    summary counters.

## 8. Local API Server

- [x] Complete auth/user context stubs enough for local integrations.
  - [x] Accept local bearer tokens, expose deterministic `/id` and
    `/services/oauth2/userinfo` payloads, and support `X-GLADE-User-Id` for
    selecting existing local users without echoing unknown IDs.
  - **Limitation**: this is a deterministic local testing stub, not OAuth
    security.
- [x] Expand Salesforce-like error response shapes and status codes.
  - [x] Return JSON error arrays with stable `errorCode`, `message`, and DML
    `fields` details for missing objects/records, method mismatches, malformed
    JSON/SOQL, DML validation, unsupported Tooling objects, and unsupported
    Composite batch requests.
- [x] Complete `/services/data` resource discovery for commonly used REST
  resources.
  - [x] Advertise version, root resources, SObject, query/queryAll, limits,
    Tooling, Composite, and Glade fixture/reset links with request-versioned
    URLs.
- [x] Expand SObject REST resources: describe, layout-adjacent metadata where
  useful, recent, query, queryAll, and record CRUD edge cases.
  - [x] Decode normal REST JSON payloads, preserve explicit nulls, return
    record/query/recent `attributes.type` and `attributes.url`, include common
    describe field metadata, and make `queryAll` include soft-deleted rows.
  - **Limitation**: full layout metadata and every Salesforce describe field are
    still outside the local subset.
- [x] Expand Tooling API coverage beyond `executeAnonymous` and query
  delegation.
  - [x] Cover GET and POST `executeAnonymous` success/failure shapes, rollback
    on runtime failure, local limit-mode execution, supported local-object
    Tooling queries, and stable unsupported errors for unmodeled Tooling objects.
  - **Limitation**: Tooling SObjects such as `ApexClass`, `ApexTrigger`,
    `ApexLog`, and `TraceFlag` are not modeled.
- [ ] Add more REST resources used by local integrations and editor tooling.
  - Current covered resources are the local data, limits, Tooling,
    Composite-sObjects, and Glade fixture/reset subset. Broader resources should
    be added only with black-box fixtures.
- [x] Add Composite API coverage beyond baseline sObject insert, including
  all-or-none rollback and reference ID behavior.
  - [x] Preserve result ordering, echo `referenceId`, return per-record
    `id`/`success`/`errors`, commit partial successes when `allOrNone=false`,
    and roll back exact all-or-none failure batches.
  - **Limitation**: broad Composite batch/Graph APIs return explicit unsupported
    errors rather than shallow fake behavior.
- [ ] Add Bulk API approximations if needed by local integration tests.
  - Bulk API remains intentionally unimplemented until a fixture-backed local
    integration need appears.
- [x] Ensure anonymous Apex runs against the same persistent server database,
  transaction boundaries, user context, and limits.
  - [x] Tooling `executeAnonymous` uses the server org/store, cloned-org commit
    boundary, VM default local user context, and server limit mode.
- [x] Add server fixture reset endpoints for test data, org state, limits, and
  async queues.
  - [x] Support full reset plus scoped `data`, `users`, `platform`, `limits`,
    and `async` reset requests via path, query, and JSON body scopes.
- [x] Add black-box server compatibility fixtures for CRUD, query,
  executeAnonymous, composite, errors, auth stubs, and persistence.
  - [x] `docs/fixtures/server-black-box.json` now covers resource discovery,
    OAuth/id stubs, SObject CRUD/describe/recent/query/queryAll, Tooling,
    Composite sObjects, explicit unsupported Composite batch, Glade
    fixture/reset, error arrays, and SQLite persistence after reset.

  triggers, storage seed/export, server routes, LSP, and watch mode.
- [x] Add stress tests for large projects, large fixtures, bulk DML, and
  describe-heavy execution.
  - [x] Add bounded normal-suite stress tests for large type-index builds,
    SQLite fixture round-trips, bulk DML partial results, and repeated describe
    execution.

- [x] Add deterministic replay bundles and a project readiness report for local
  integration gates.
  - [x] `glade compat replay` loads directory bundles, runs ordered in-process
    compat steps, emits stable JSON/text reports, rejects path escapes, and can
    export redacted failure artifacts.
  - [x] `glade compat readiness --project <root>` reports parser, project,
    schema, sema, stdlib, SOQL, DML, trigger, limit, storage, server, and unknown
    blockers without mutating the project.
  - [x] Add bounded replay smoke coverage for selector/service/domain and
    server-backed bundles under `testdata/replay`.
