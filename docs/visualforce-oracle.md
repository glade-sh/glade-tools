# Visualforce Oracle Capture

The Visualforce oracle lane compares Salesforce server-side HTML/PDF output
from `Page.getContent*` with local `glade dev vf` HTML/PDF output. It uses the probe project in
`docs/fixtures/visualforce/probe-project` and the scratch org alias
`oaer-probe-max`.

## Fixture Summary

```bash
go run ./cmd/glade-tools visualforce summary \
  --project docs/fixtures/visualforce/probe-project --json
```

Use `--phase <n>` to narrow capture, diff, or summary to one probe-index
phase. The checked probe project currently carries phase 1 rows for lifecycle,
security, expressions, fields, tables, standard controllers, custom
components, static resources, uploads, AJAX, remoting, Remote Objects,
Lightning Out server markup, Flow link pages, templates, and PDF fallback.
This oracle does not execute browser JavaScript. Browser-mounted LWC and
Lightning Out behavior stays covered by the product `lwcruntime` tests.

## Salesforce Capture

```bash
mkdir -p reports/visualforce
go run ./cmd/glade-tools visualforce capture \
  --target-org oaer-probe-max \
  --project docs/fixtures/visualforce/probe-project \
  --phase 1 \
  --out reports/visualforce/salesforce-phase1.json
```

Add `--skip-deploy` only after the same metadata has already been deployed to
the target org. Use `--batch-size <n>` when Apex log volume or org limits ask
for smaller probe runs.

## Local Capture

Build the matching Glade binary first, then capture the local renderer:

```bash
(cd ../glade && go build -o /tmp/glade-vf ./cmd/glade)
go run ./cmd/glade-tools visualforce capture \
  --local \
  --glade-bin /tmp/glade-vf \
  --project docs/fixtures/visualforce/probe-project \
  --phase 1 \
  --out reports/visualforce/local-phase1.json
```

## Diff

```bash
go run ./cmd/glade-tools visualforce diff \
  --salesforce reports/visualforce/salesforce-phase1.json \
  --local reports/visualforce/local-phase1.json \
  --project docs/fixtures/visualforce/probe-project \
  --phase 1 \
  --out reports/visualforce/diff-phase1.json
```

The diff report redacts raw payloads from console output, keeps hash and
normalized text evidence, and groups movement by probe group, owner, and
category.
