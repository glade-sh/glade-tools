# Plugin Registry Setup

`glade-tools` is the private source repo for the first-party Glade plugins.
`glade` is still the product front door. It reads a registry JSON endpoint,
downloads one platform archive, checks SHA-256, checks the archive manifest, and
then records the installed plugin.

The default endpoint in `glade` is:

```text
https://plugins.glade.sh/index.json
```

That host must serve static JSON and tarballs before plain coordinate installs
work:

```bash
glade plugins available
glade plugins install @glade/compat
glade plugins install @glade/performance
```

Until that endpoint exists, use a direct archive or local link:

```bash
glade plugins install ./dist/plugins/glade-plugin-compat_0.1.0_darwin_arm64.tar.gz --yes
glade plugins link --exec ./glade-plugin-compat
```

## Source Repo

The source repo is private:

```text
https://github.com/glade-sh/glade-tools
```

Keep `glade-tools` beside `glade` when building from source. `go.mod` uses:

```text
module github.com/glade-sh/glade/tools
replace github.com/glade-sh/glade => ../glade
replace github.com/glade-sh/apex-parser => ../glade/third_party/glade-apex-parser
```

Do not change that module path just to match the repository name. The tools
import `github.com/glade-sh/glade/internal/...`, and Go only allows that because
the module path still sits under `github.com/glade-sh/glade`.

## Build Archives

Build release archives with a version and an asset base URL. The script writes
tarballs, `checksums.txt`, and `index.json` under `dist/plugins`.

```bash
OUT_DIR=dist/plugins \
TARGETS="darwin/arm64 darwin/amd64 linux/arm64 linux/amd64" \
PLUGIN_ASSET_BASE_URL="https://plugins.glade.sh/v0.1.0" \
scripts/build-plugin-archives.sh 0.1.0
```

The generated `index.json` is the registry catalog. Each row names the plugin,
aliases, version, trust label, docs URL, source URL, commands, platform assets,
and archive SHA-256.

`dist/` is ignored. Do not commit release tarballs or generated registry output
to the source repo.

## Endpoint Choices

The source can stay private while the endpoint is public or signed. Current
`glade` sends ordinary HTTP requests to the registry and asset URLs. It does not
send GitHub tokens or custom authorization headers.

Use one of these setups:

- Public static endpoint: upload `index.json`, `checksums.txt`, and tarballs to
  `plugins.glade.sh`. This supports the default install commands.
- Private source with direct archives: keep releases private and install from a
  local tarball path after downloading the artifact yourself.
- End-to-end private endpoint: add authenticated registry and asset downloads to
  `glade`, then host `index.json` and tarballs behind that auth layer.

For the first public endpoint cut, upload this shape:

```text
https://plugins.glade.sh/index.json
https://plugins.glade.sh/v0.1.0/glade-plugin-compat_0.1.0_darwin_arm64.tar.gz
https://plugins.glade.sh/v0.1.0/glade-plugin-performance_0.1.0_darwin_arm64.tar.gz
```

The `index.json` asset URLs must match their hosted paths and SHA-256 values.

## Smoke Test

Use a clean `GLADE_HOME` before pointing normal installs at the endpoint:

```bash
tmp="$(mktemp -d)"
GLADE_HOME="$tmp" glade plugins install ./dist/plugins/glade-plugin-compat_0.1.0_darwin_arm64.tar.gz --yes
GLADE_HOME="$tmp" glade plugins list
GLADE_HOME="$tmp" glade plugins which compat
```

For a hosted registry:

```bash
tmp="$(mktemp -d)"
GLADE_HOME="$tmp" GLADE_PLUGIN_REGISTRY_URL="https://plugins.glade.sh/index.json" glade plugins available
GLADE_HOME="$tmp" GLADE_PLUGIN_REGISTRY_URL="https://plugins.glade.sh/index.json" glade plugins install @glade/compat --yes
```
